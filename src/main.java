/*
        router boots opens its fixed port number
        nodes boot and generate random port number for client and server threads
        nodes authenticate with router (maybe find router by a broadcast message?)
        router adds nodes details to arraylist (routing table)
        node-client opens a text file
        node-client broadcasts a server request.
        node-client starts timing
        router uses the lookup and forwards the request
        node-server receives the request and replies
        router forwards the reply
        node-client logs time
        node-client broadcasts a line from the file (logging the size of the line)
        node-server responds with uppercase version of the line
        node-client logs the time of the response received.
        node-client repeats message sending to EOF
        node-client requests close of connection
        node-client transmits all connection data to router
        router appends all received connection data to a file
